# LibraryManagementSystems
Libraries currently use a manual system for the management and maintenance of information. The current system requires numerous paper forms with data storage. The manual handling of the record is time-consuming and highly prone to errors. The purpose of this project is to automate the activities such as searching for a book or making record of the borrowed books, etc. The Library Management System provides exact information about the number of books that are taken by the users, the number of books that are left,date of issue etc and it even calculates the fine automatically, thereby reducing the risk present in the manual management of libraries
